5.0
##########################
The 5.0 update brings Infinite Fusion to a new engine, which makes the game run better and allows
for a variety of improvements. 
However, there are also a handful features that were in previous versions of the game which are not 
compatible with this new version of Pokemon Essentials and that have been removed. Some of them will
be added back progressively in future updates and some of them will likely be gone for good.
