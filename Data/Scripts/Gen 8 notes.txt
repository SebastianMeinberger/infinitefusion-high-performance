Marks, which are symbols randomly given to wild Pokémon which append a title to
its name when sent out in battle. A Pokémon can only have 0 or 1 marks. The
title can be toggled. Ribbons also provide a title, and can similarly be
toggled. (Probably don't bother implementing.)

Super shininess. Only difference is an alternate shiny common animation with
square sparkles; a mon is super shiny if the calculated number that is compared
to Settings::SHINY_POKEMON_CHANCE is exactly 0.

The game records, for each species, how many have been caught or defeated
(counts both wild and trainer battles), and the shiny chance increases for that
species because of this. This value is also shown in the Pokédex entry screen.

"Pokémon no longer lose access to moves by evolving." I'm not sure what this
means. Maybe evolving causes the first_moves to be cleared (in the GF games; it
isn't cleared in Essentials)? In Gen 8+, a taught TR should be added to the
first_moves array.

Some moves have changed properties/effects.

Can now give a Rare Candy to a max level Pokémon, which will trigger its
evolution (presumably the item isn't consumed if it can't at least try to evolve
it).

Bicycle that can work on water.

Town Map added to the pause menu (don't bother adding). Can use Fly from within
the Town Map if possible (good QoL, add if possible).

Remote access to storage boxes. Add an option to the pause screen for this
unless Settings::HEAL_STORED_POKEMON?
