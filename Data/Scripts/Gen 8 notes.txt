Marks, which are symbols randomly given to wild Pokémon which append a title to
its name when sent out in battle. A Pokémon can only have 0 or 1 marks. The
title can be toggled. Ribbons also provide a title, and can similarly be
toggled.

Super shininess (only difference is an alternate shiny common animation with
square sparkles; a mon is super shiny if the calculated number that is compared
to SHINY_POKEMON_CHANCE is exactly 0)

Look at methods of increasing shiny chance.

Form differences.

Changes to evolutions due to removal of moss rock/ice rock/magnetic field.

Some (12) existing species changed egg groups.

Aegislash's stats changed.

2 existing Pokémon gained new abilities.

Pokémon no longer lose access to moves by evolving.

Move moves have changed properties/effects. Vice Grip becomes Vise Grip.

Can now give a Rare Candy to a max level Pokémon, which will trigger its
evolution (presumably the item isn't consumed if it can't at least try to evolve
it).

Bicycle that can work on water.

Town Map added to the pause menu. Can use Fly from within the Town Map if
possible.

Remote access to storage boxes, and Pokémon sent to storage aren't healed.
