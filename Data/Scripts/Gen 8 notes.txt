# To do
#===============================================================================

The game records, for each species, how many have been caught or defeated
(counts both wild and trainer battles), and the shiny chance increases for that
species because of this. This value is also shown in the Pokédex entry screen.

Some moves have changed properties/effects.

Can use Fly from within the Town Map if possible. (Good QoL, add if possible.)

Example event that combines the Gen 8 fossils.

New evolution methods:
- Galarian Farfetch'd: performing 3 critical hits in a single battle

PBS file data:
- Form differences.
- Moveset changes.
- Changes to evolutions due to removal of moss rock/ice rock/magnetic field.
- Some (12) existing species changed egg groups.
- Aegislash's stats changed.
- 2 existing Pokémon gained new abilities.
- Vice Grip becomes Vise Grip.
- Some items change names (Stick -> Leek, etc.).

Add AI for new moves/items/abilities.

# Low priority or ignorable

Marks, which are symbols randomly given to wild Pokémon which append a title to
its name when sent out in battle. A Pokémon can only have 0 or 1 marks. The
title can be toggled. Ribbons also provide a title, and can similarly be
toggled. (Probably don't bother implementing.)

Bicycle that can work on water.

Town Map added to the pause menu. (Don't bother adding.)

Remote access to storage boxes. See the Pokémon Box Link item.

New evolution methods:
- Milcery: spinning while holding an item. (Doesn't suit our control scheme,
           we're not adding a way to easily spin on the spot just for this, cf.
           not having to turn your computer upside-down to evolve Inkay.)
- Galarian Yamask: going to a particular spot after a battle in which it lost
                   49+ HP from a single attack and hasn't fainted since then;
                   healing doesn't affect this. (Utter nonsense, find a better
                   way.)

#===============================================================================
# Implemented
#===============================================================================

Pokémon sent to storage aren't healed - see Settings::HEAL_STORED_POKEMON.

Super shininess. Only difference is an alternate shiny common animation with
square sparkles; a mon is super shiny if the calculated number that is compared
to Settings::SHINY_POKEMON_CHANCE is exactly 0 - see Settings::SUPER_SHINY.

Can now give a Rare Candy to a max level Pokémon, which will trigger its
evolution (presumably the item isn't consumed if it can't at least try to evolve
it) - see Settings::RARE_CANDY_USABLE_AT_MAX_LEVEL.

In Gen 8+, a taught TR should be added to the Pokémon's first_moves array. This
is done regardless of Generation, and doesn't need to be limited to Gen 8+.

New evolution methods:
- Kubfu (triggered by an event; Kubfu's form can be set beforehand by the event,
  so don't worry about the multiple forms it can evolve into)
